My personal portfolio website

Meet my hilarious portfolio—where code meets comedy! I built an interactive showcase on myself featured as a royal pug (my majestic alter ego), a self-deprecating humor about my coding 'skills,' The site randomly changes colors, mocks my own bugs, and even claims my cat helps debug JavaScript. It's a playful twist on developer portfolios that doesn't take itself too seriously, just like me!

I built this playful portfolio to showcase my first-ever beginner coding skills with a twist of humor. The project features a royal pug as my furry alter ego, a mischievous "Don't Click" button that triggers silly effects, and random color-changing surprises. I had fun breaking the tradition of portfolio rules by adding self-deprecating jokes about my bugs (blaming hardware, of  course) and pretending my cat helps debug JavaScript. Every element—from the rebellious button to the fake "vote counter " - was designed to make visitors smile while demonstrating my HTML/CSS/JS skills. The pug demanded a crown, so who was I to argue? Future updates may include more chaotic interactions, because why should portfolios be boring?
